Hangman - Time to save your friends
===================================

Android implementation of the original hangman game

In Hangman you try to guess a word by guessing individual letters. Every time you select a letter which is not in the to be guessed word, you get one step closer to being hanged.

What's new in this version of Hangman is that you would be able to select your own set of condemned people which you will be trying to save during the game from being hanged. You can let your friends know how well you did saving them (or didn't) by sharing your statistics on social media.
